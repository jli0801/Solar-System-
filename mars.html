	<span> Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, Mercury being the first smallest. Mars comes from the Roman God of War 
	and due to it’s color, it is also called the “Red Planet.” The reddish color comes from the iron oxide on the surface and Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere. 
	The surface of Mars is similar to the Moon with impact craters and it has valleys, desert and polar ice caps like those on the Earth. </span>
	<span> The rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars is similar to those of Earth and has seasons. Mars harvests the largest volcano and 
	second-highest known mountain in the Solar System, and one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, 
	which are small and irregularly shaped. Its orbit is about 142 million miles from the sun, making it 50 percent farther than the Earth. The days on Mars last 24.6 
	hours and the year lasts around 687 Earth Days. </span>
	<span> Due to the polar ice caps, ongoing investigations about possible life on Mars have been occurring. However, liquid water cannot exist on the surface 
	of Mars due to low atmospheric pressure. The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water. If melted, then the volume of water ice in the south polar ice 
	cap would be enough to cover the entire surface with a depth of 11 meters. The volume of water can be compared to or even equivalent to the amount in Lake Superior. </span>
