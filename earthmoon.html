	<span> The Moon is a natural satellite that orbits planet Earth. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among the 
	satellites that are close to the size of the planet that it orbits. The Moon is second-densest satellite. The average distance of the Moon from the Earth is 
	384,400 km. The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.5 billion years ago. The most widely accepted explanation of its appearance is that the Moon formed from the 
	debris left over after an impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia. </span>
	<span> The Moon is always synchronous with Earth, and shows the same face, of dark volcanic plains and the impact craters. It is the second-brightest 
	regularly visible object in Earth's sky, after the Sun. Its surface is actually dark, although it appears very bright to us. Its prominence in the sky and its regular 
	cycle of phases has given the Moon an influence over numerous cultures and implemented itself in several languages, calendars, mythology and even art. </span>
	<span> The Moon's gravitational influence creates the ocean tides, body tides, and even the slight lengthening of the day. The Moon's current orbital distance is 
	about thirty times the diameter of Earth. Itâ€™s the only celestial body that has been visited by human beings. Its year and day lasts 27 Earth days. </span>
