	</h1> 
	<span class = "des1"> Venus is the second planet from the Sun, next to Mercury. Venus is a dim world of intense heat and volcanic activity. 
	The planet is similar in structure and size to Earth, making its nickname is Earth's "sister planet". Like the Earth, Venus has a greenhouse effect due to its
	​thick, toxic atmosphere. The heat is enough to melt lead! </span>
	<span class = "des2"> It’s about 67 million miles away from the sun, which is about 3/4 as far as the Earth is from the sun. 
	It has the longest rotation period of 243 days in the Solar System and rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets. 
	It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. To humans on earth, it is the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon. 
	Venus is a terrestrial, which means it is composed of rocks or metal, planet and made up of carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. </span>
	<span class = "des3"> Around 80% of the Venusian surface is covered by smooth, volcanic plain with 70% plains with wrinkle ridges and 10% smooth plains. 
	Two continents that make up the rest of its surface area lays on the northern hemisphere and the other on the south of the equator. The northern continent is 
	called Ishtar Terra and is around the size of Australia. The highest mountain on Venus is called Maxwell Montes and is at Ishtar Terra. 
	Venus is known as a volcanic and mountainous planet and its peak is 11 km above the average surface elevation on Venus. </span>
