	<span> Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and has the third largest radius with fourth largest mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to 
	Neptune, and both have different chemical composition from the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. Because of this, scientists often classify Uranus and Neptune as 
	ice giants to distinguish them from the gas giants. Uranus was officially discovered by Sir William Herschel in 1781. It was first thought to be a comet, but several 
	years later it was confirmed as a planet. </span>
	<span> Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" 
	such as water, ammonia, and methane. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 27 small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the 
	its orbit. It is the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System and has a complex structure with water when it comes to clouds. </span> 
	<span> Uranus is the only planet whose name is derived from the Greek god of the sky Ouranos. Its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the 
	plane of its solar orbit.This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side, orbiting the sun like a rolling ball.  Its north and south poles, therefore, 
	lie where most other planets have their equators. Images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as plain planet with no features, clouds or storms. Observations from Earth 
	have shown seasonal change and increased weather activity in 2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second. </span>
