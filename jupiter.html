	<span> Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet. Jupiter is a gas giant, like Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. 
	The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. It’s the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus. Jupiter is primarily composed of 
	hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium. Its mass is one-thousandths of the Sun’s mass. It is 2.5 times the total weight of the other planets in the Solar System. 
	Jupiter's radius is about 1/10 the radius of the Sun. Like other planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface.  </span>
	<span> Jupiter had a ring system and a powerful magnetic field. Jupiter has at least 67 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by 
	Galileo Galilei in 1610. Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are the four largest moons. The orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede form a pattern known as a Laplace resonance. 
	Every four orbits that Io makes around Jupiter, Europa makes two orbits and Ganymede makes one. Jupiter also has three rings, but they’re harder to see and are not prominent 
	when compared to Saturn. </span>
	<span> Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system. One day on Jupiter takes only about 10 hours and Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the 
	Sun in about 12 Earth years. Its equator is tilted on its by just 3 degrees. This means Jupiter spins close to upright and does not have extreme seasons. </span>
